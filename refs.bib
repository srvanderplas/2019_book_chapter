The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148â€“156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

This recognition problem is made difficult by the variability in types of crime scene evidence (ranging from traces of dust or oil on hard surfaces to impressions made in soil) and the lack of comprehensive databases of shoe outsole tread patterns. We find that mid-level features extracted by pre-trained convolutional neural nets are surprisingly effective descriptors for this specialized domains. However, the choice of similarity measure for matching exemplars to a query image is essential to good performance. For matching multi-channel deep features, we propose the use of multi-channel normalized cross-correlation and analyze its effectiveness. Our proposed metric significantly improves performance in matching crime scene shoeprints to laboratory test impressions. We also show its effectiveness in other cross-domain image retrieval problems: matching facade images to segmentation labels and aerial photos to map images. Finally, we introduce a discriminatively trained variant and fine-tune our system through our proposed metric, obtaining state-of-the-art performance.},

	abstract = {The examination of forensic toolmarks impressed on shot cartridges and bullets is a well known and broadly accepted forensic discipline. The underlying concept is based on two main hypotheses: every firearm owns unique toolmark characteristics which lead to consistent and reproducible impressions on cartridges and bullets. Furthermore, it is possible to differentiate between markings of two different firearms. The application of optical 2D and 3D sensing technologies for acquisition, as well as pattern recognition techniques for automated toolmark examination are currently emerging fields of research in the domain of digital crime scene analysis. In this paper we propose and evaluate a pattern recognition approach for automated firearm identification based on central-fire firing pin impressions. The entire pattern recognition chain is addressed, starting with a confocal microscope for optical data acquisition. The preprocessing covers image enhancement, as well as necessary registration and segmentation tasks for cartridge bottoms. Feature extraction involves 18 firing pin related features from 2D and 3D spatial domain. The classification accuracy is evaluated by using 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Our evaluation approach is two-fold, during the first part we examine how well it is possible to differentiate between two firearms of the same mark and model. During the second part the evaluation is extended to analyze the accuracy of discrimination using six different weapons, whereby each two guns are of the same model. The test set contains 72 cartridge samples including three different ammunition manufactures and six individual 9mm guns. Every possible combination of weapon model, instance and ammunition type is represented by four samples within the test set. Regarding the first evaluation goal a classification accuracy between 87.5\% and 100\% is achieved. For the second evaluation goal the achieved classification accuracy equates to 86.11\%.},

Empirical validation of the method is established through experiments based on tool marks made at selected fixed angles from 50 sequentially manufactured screwdriver tips. Results obtained from three different comparison scenarios are presented and are in agreement with experiential knowledge possessed by practicing examiners. Further comparisons between scores produced by the algorithm and visual assessments of the same tool mark pairs by professional tool mark examiners in a blind study in general show good agreement between the algorithm and human experts. In specific instances where the algorithm had difficulty in assessing a particular comparison pair, results obtained during the collaborative study with professional examiners suggest ways in which algorithm performance may be improved. It is concluded that the addition of contextual information when inputting data into the algorithm should result in better performance.},
